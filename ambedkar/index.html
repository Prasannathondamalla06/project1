            <p>Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar (14 April 1891 – 6 December 1956) was an Indian jurist, economist, social reformer
                and political leader who headed the committee drafting the Constitution of India from the Constituent
                Assembly debates, served as Law and Justice minister in the first cabinet of Jawaharlal Nehru, and
                inspired the Dalit Buddhist movement after renouncing Hinduism.

                Ambedkar graduated from Elphinstone College, University of Bombay, and studied economics at Columbia
                University and the London School of Economics, receiving doctorates in 1927 and 1923 respectively and
                was among a handful of Indian students to have done so at either institution in the 1920s.[13] He also
                trained in the law at Gray's Inn, London. In his early career, he was an economist, professor, and
                lawyer. His later life was marked by his political activities; he became involved in campaigning and
                negotiations for India's independence, publishing journals, advocating political rights and social
                freedom for Dalits, and contributing significantly to the establishment of the state of India. In 1956,
                he converted to Buddhism, initiating mass conversions of Dalits
                Ramji Sakpal retired in 1894 and the family moved to Satara two years later. Shortly after their move,
                Ambedkar's mother died. The children were cared for by their paternal aunt and lived in difficult
                circumstances. Three sons – Balaram, Anandrao and Bhimrao – and two daughters – Manjula and Tulasa – of
                the Ambedkars survived them. Of his brothers and sisters, only Ambedkar passed his examinations and went
                to high school.</p>

    <p> 1907, he passed his matriculation examination and in the following year he entered Elphinstone College, which was affiliated to the University of Bombay, becoming, according to him, the first from his Mahar caste to do so. When he passed his English fourth standard examinations, the people of his community wanted to celebrate because they considered that he had reached "great heights" which he says was "hardly an occasion compared to the state of education in other communities". A public ceremony was evoked, to celebrate his success, by the community, and it was at this occasion that he was presented with a biography of the Buddha by Dada Keluskar, the author and a family friendBy 1912, he obtained his degree in economics and political science from Bombay University, and prepared to take up employment with the Baroda state government. His wife had just moved his young family and started work when he had to quickly return to Mumbai to see his ailing father, who died on 2 February 1913.</p>
